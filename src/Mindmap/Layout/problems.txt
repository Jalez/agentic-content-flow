## Potential Problems with Container Nodes in ELK Layout

1. **Nested Hierarchy Handling**: 
   - ELK might not properly understand the parent-child relationships in our nested container structure
   - Children might be positioned without considering their parent container's position
   - Complex hierarchies (course > module > topic) might not maintain proper containment

2. **Container Sizing Issues**:
   - Container nodes might not be properly sized to accommodate all their children
   - When children are rearranged, container dimensions might not be updated accordingly
   - Padding and spacing between children might not be considered in container dimensions

3. **Handle Position Inconsistency**:
   - Container nodes might not have their handles positioned correctly based on layout direction
   - Child nodes might have handle positions that don't align with parent container's handles
   - Handle positions need to be consistently updated when layout direction changes

4. **Coordinate System Mismatches**:
   - ELK's coordinate system might not align with React Flow's coordinate expectations
   - Children positions might be absolute rather than relative to their parent
   - Container transformations might not be properly applied to children

5. **Layout Algorithm Limitations**:
   - Not all ELK algorithms might support container nodes equally well
   - Tree layouts might behave differently than layered layouts for containers
   - Algorithm-specific options might need adjustment for container support

6. **Performance Concerns**:
   - Large nested structures might be computationally expensive to layout
   - Frequent recalculations of container dimensions could impact performance
   - Layout cache might not be properly handling container hierarchies

7. **Style and Visual Issues**:
   - Container styling might be affected by layout changes
   - Visual elements might break when containers are resized
   - Animations and transitions might not work smoothly with nested structures

8. **Layout Direction Changes**:
   - Switching between horizontal and vertical layouts might not properly reposition containers
   - Container dimensions might need to be recalculated differently based on direction
   - Parent-child relationships might be visually broken when changing directions
