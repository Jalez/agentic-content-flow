Mindmap Component Improvement Suggestions:

1. Search/Filter functionality:
   - Add a search bar to filter nodes by label or content
   - Highlight matching nodes when searching
   - Option to show only matching nodes and their direct connections

2. Node styling improvements:
   - Add different node shapes for different types of content
   - Support for custom icons in nodes
   - Visual indicators for node relationships (prerequisite, related topics, etc.)
   - Color coding based on difficulty level or category

3. Navigation and interaction:
   - Add mini-map for easier navigation in large mindmaps
   - Zoom to fit all nodes button
   - Center on selected node
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (add node, delete, edit, etc.)
   - Pan and zoom controls that work well on touch devices


5. Layout improvements:
   - Auto-arrange nodes to prevent overlapping
   - Different layout algorithms (hierarchical, radial, force-directed)
   - Snap-to-grid option
   - Ability to group nodes into collapsible clusters
   - Ability to add a visible grid and other visual elements. 

6. Collaboration features:
   - Multi-user editing support
   - Comments/notes on nodes
   - Version history
   - Share specific views of the mindmap

7. Enhanced node content:
   - Rich text formatting in node details
   - Support for embedding images and links
   - Ability to attach files to nodes
   - Mathematical formula support
   - Code snippet support with syntax highlighting

8. Accessibility:
   - Keyboard navigation between nodes
   - Screen reader support
   - High contrast mode
   - Configurable node sizes and font sizes

9. Performance optimizations:
   - Virtual rendering for large mindmaps
   - Optimized force simulation
   - Lazy loading of node details
   - Caching of layout calculations

10. Integration features:
    - Link nodes to course materials
    - Integration with calendar for timeline view
    - Connection to learning management system
    - API for external tools to modify the mindmap (so that exercises can for instance add mindmap items)
